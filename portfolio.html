<h1>Project 1</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"></
<p>The purpose of the story is for someone to successfully escape prison. However, depending 
on the choices the user makes, it will affect the outcome of the story. With the collaboration between my partner and I, Cecilia Mendoza, we created 
a story that has some features of a game incorporated. For instance,  the user will first start off in a prison and from there, they will go through many stages until they
have reached the final stage which will determine if the person succeeded or failed. Although I did experience some flaws during the process, some improvements that were made
on the program were adding more scenes to make itmore complex, so that the user could have better comprehensibilty on the program. During the process I learned new vocabulary,
for example, abstraction was a word I thought was related to art; however, abstraction is practically the complexity of the program for this concept. Another thing that I learned 
was how to be efficent, meaning after a while I fnd a way to manage my time and complete the task correctly. Looking back at how I made the program, what I think I did well was 
having the tasks identified before creating the story. However, the things I woud change are inlcuding more algorithms within the algorithm, and add more stages so that the user can have a better understanding of the events occur in in the story.
