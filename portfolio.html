<h1>Project 1</h1>

<p>
The purpose of the story that we created in Scratch was for the user to successfully escape a prison with 
        obstacles the user had to overcome in order to reach the end of the story. The path the user takes will vary in outcomes,
        such as the user going through the correct path and finishing the game by triumphantly escaping, or the user can diverge
        into the wrong path and continue following the wrong path eventually leading to failure. However, depending on the choices the user makes, it will affect the outcome of the story.

With the collaboration between my partner and I, 
Cecilia Mendoza, we created a story that has some features of a game system incorporated. For instance,  the user will first start 
off in a prison and from there, they will go through many stages until they have reached the final stage which will determine 
if the person succeeded or failed.

Although there were some flaws in the process such as, some commands not functioning properly, starting with an idea that led nowhere, which made us change the beginning of our our code,
but my partner and I managed out time properly to create the Prison Break game. Some improvements that were made
on the program were adding more scenes providing comprehension for the user, in order for he/she to thoroughly understand the game.
During the process I learned new vocabulary, for example, abstraction was a word I thought was related to art; however, abstraction 
is practically managing or reducing the complexity of the program for this concept. Another thing that I learned was how to be efficent, meaning after a 
while I found a way to manage my time and complete the task correctly. Looking back at how I made the program, what I think I did well was 
having the tasks identified before creating the story. In having the tasks identified it is beneficial for my partner and I becuase then it will be easier 
to create the overall program and get straight to the point. However, the things I would change are including more algorithms within the
algorithm, and add more stages so that the user can have a better understanding of the events occurring in the story.

The reason I would like to include more algorithm is because in 
including more algorithms then the complexity of the program reduces; therefore, if there are any future issues then it will be easy to identify the location of each problem.
Another aspect I would change in this program is to have more interaction with the user because the game only requires them to click an image.
The algorithm that was implemented in a logical form are the if-else statements. The if-else statements fall under the Bollean data type because it is a true or false statement. 
For example, the user has two choices from which to choose one, but if the user chooses the key then the program identifies to see which path correponds to that choice,
and if it is not the deal then it does not take the user through that specific path.
