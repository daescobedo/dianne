<h1>This is my About Me Page!</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Dianne Escobedo and unfortuantely I am living another year in high school. Although I love academics, I do get exhausted often as well.
I am a quiet person when I want to be, but I am an energetic goof ball. I am currently 5'9", which is not normal for a girl. I am also involved in activities provided by the school meaning clubs, not much of an athletic person. 
I have a dog that I love, named Kai</p>
